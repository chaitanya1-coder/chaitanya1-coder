## Hello World 👋
#### Developer Relations Engineer 

I am Chaitanya, a passionate coder. I have more than three years of experience in building and scaling developers communities and currently working as a Developer Relations Engineer. My technical interests are Web Development, Machine Learning and Blockchain. 
I love to travel and explore new places. I believe that technology has the power to change anything and no matter how, using technology we can solve each and every problem of this world. I am managing TensorFlow User group Delhi community and have successfully led the Google Developer Students Club of my campus. 
As a community leader, I have scaled my community to 5x active community members in a spam of 6 months, and organised multiple technical events in the field of Machine Learning, Web Development, and Cloud Computing.
I am actively contributing in some Web3 projects these days and exploring blockchain.
